# AP-Experiment-3 (LINKED LIST)

## Step for solving the problem

1. Understand the Problem 

2. Divide the Problem into subpart 

3. Identify Input, Logic, and Output: Focus on what data is given, the logic needed, and the expected results. 

4. Approach to Solve: Find the most efficient solution. 

5. Time Efficiency: Focus on solutions with less computational time. 

6. Pseudocode and Dry Run: Plan the solution and test with sample inputs. 

7. Evaluate Complexity: Use Big O notation to assess time and space complexity

## Linked List 
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in memory non-contiguously. Each node consists of two parts: 

          Data â†’ Stores the actual value. 

          Pointer (Next) â†’ Stores the address of the next node. 

Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions & deletions without requiring shifting.

## Types of Linked Lists 

1. Singly Linked List â†’ Each node points to the next node only. 

2. Doubly Linked List â†’ Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes. 

3. Circular Linked List â†’ The last node connects back to the first node.

## List of Practical to be Performed

### Questions Marked CW (class work) are designed to be covered in class as they cover important concepts						
### Questions Marked HW (home work) might be given as homework, or as further work to students already done with classwork questions. They might also be covered in class itself if time found.
