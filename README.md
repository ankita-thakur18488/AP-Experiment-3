# AP-Experiment-3
## Step for solving the problem
1. Understand the Problem 

2. Divide the Problem into subpart 

3. Identify Input, Logic, and Output: Focus on what data is given, the logic needed, and the expected results. 

4. Approach to Solve: Find the most efficient solution. 

5. Time Efficiency: Focus on solutions with less computational time. 

6. Pseudocode and Dry Run: Plan the solution and test with sample inputs. 

Evaluate Complexity: Use Big O notation to assess time and space complexity

## Linked List 
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in memory non-contiguously. Each node consists of two parts: 

          Data → Stores the actual value. 

          Pointer (Next) → Stores the address of the next node. 

Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions & deletions without requiring shifting.

## Types of Linked Lists 

1. Singly Linked List → Each node points to the next node only. 

2. Doubly Linked List → Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes. 

3. Circular Linked List → The last node connects back to the first node.
