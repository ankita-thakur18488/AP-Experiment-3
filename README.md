# AP-Experiment-3

Understand the Problem 

Divide the Problem into subpart 

Identify Input, Logic, and Output: Focus on what data is given, the logic needed, and the expected results. 

Approach to Solve: Find the most efficient solution. 

Time Efficiency: Focus on solutions with less computational time. 

Pseudocode and Dry Run: Plan the solution and test with sample inputs. 

Evaluate Complexity: Use Big O notation to assess time and space complexity

Linked List 
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in memory non-contiguously. Each node consists of two parts: 

Data → Stores the actual value. 

Pointer (Next) → Stores the address of the next node. 

Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions & deletions without requiring shifting.
